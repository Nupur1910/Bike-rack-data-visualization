Negative,"I much prefer the horizontal ones like they have outside of Coor, way less of a pain to get your bike properly locked too",Masters
Negative,700c locks better on both. If I�m on a 26in wheel bike I can only use the horizontal racks,Bachelors
Negative,"I dislike the vertical ones. It�s hard to get a u lock to lock through a wheel and the frame. And impossible to do it with the rear wheel, which some people prefer. They are more space efficient though but that�s the only argument that I could see for them",Bachelors
Negative,"Ah those, I don't use the vertical ones much at all. Only used them at the sdfc. I always tend to avoid those just cause they're an extra step . They are good for space saving though.",Masters
Positive,I personally use vertical racks. Saves space,Bachelors
Negative,I find vertical bike racks to be a waste of space. Nobody likes using them. It makes it harder to unload my panniers on my bike's rear rack.,Bachelors
Positive,"Personally, I liked the verticle ones because lack of bike tangling like the horizontal ones, but one downside is strength needed to lift the bike is tough for some people",Bachelors
Negative,"The vertical bike racks are only saving space if they are against the wall. I prefer to use the horizontal ones, because I lock my bike up faster that way. Also, lifting your bike up vertically after a ride is inconvenient and tiring.",Staff
Negative,I prefer horizontal Bike Racks. I have 2 electric scooters. One of them cannot even be parked vertically. U locks work better with electric scooters in the horizontal position.,Bachelors
Negative,"My electric Scooter has a front wheel motor, so it isn't possible for it to be locked vertically. I prefer to bring my scooter inside if I can in classes, but only horizontal racks work for me.",Bachelors
Negative,I have dropped my bike on accident when failing to mount it in the vertical bike racks,Bachelors
Negative,"I have so far been able to always find a nice horizontal rack to park my bike at. When I see my friends lift their heavy bikes onto the vertical racks, it looks like a pain.",Masters
Negative,Horizontal Racks are easier to park and take off,Bachelors
Negative, Verticals are more work to park, Bachelors
Negative, I do think the space it saves is a pro, but the process to hang the vertical bike rack isn't as efficient and not worth it,Bachelors
